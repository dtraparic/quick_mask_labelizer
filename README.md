# quick_mask_labelizer
This can be assigned to the "Quick Selection" tool of Photoshop (maybe not as efficient but in the same use and idea).

The motive : to use the "Quick Selection" tool on multiple images one after another, quickly and freely.
My context : Labelization of an image database with binary *masks* on objects or people, etc.
The needs : Being fast to use, with keyboard inputs possible (already quite there by default on web with `tab`)
